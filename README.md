**What is tcl?**
TCL, which stands for Tool Command Language, is a versatile and dynamic scripting language. With its clear and concise syntax, TCL is widely used in various domains, including software development, network administration, and embedded systems. It offers a rich set of built-in commands and supports seamless integration with C/C++ code. TCL's flexibility and ease of use make it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced programmers seeking efficient and powerful scripting capabilities.

**Obejctive :**
Create a unique User Interface(UI) that takes RTL netlist & SDC constraints as inputs, and generate synthesized netlsit and Pre-layout timing report as an output. It should use Yosys Open source tool for synthesis and Opentimer to generate pre-layout timing reports

**Steps to follow to achieve the objective :**

Create a command and pass .csv file from UNIX shell to tcl script
